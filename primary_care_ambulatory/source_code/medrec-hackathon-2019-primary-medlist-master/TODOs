TO DO List:

Coordinator:
	- pull data from FHIR-PITs/OpenEMR
		- add note element to FHIR MedicationStatement/MedicationRequest resource, indicating when pulled
	- compare against what we've already received
		- if nothing, coordinate sources and save/present list
		- if something, compare against original sources
	- create RESTful API to access pt medlist
		- create - add pt
				 - add medication
				 - add note to medication record (pt view)
		- retrieve - with pt information
				- retrieve medication list
		- update
				- modify medication in list
		- delete
				- "soft delete" - update record

MongoDB:
	Define DB (JSON) or do we want mongo as a repository for the medication objects??
	- need place to store original data from EHRs
	- need place to store metadata
	- patient centric, but ideally maybe have an EMPI that pulls together patient identifiers
	original data
	- Patient Resource
		MedicationStatement
		MedicationRequest
	cloud-based data	
	
	
PostgreSQL:
	Might give us a better handle on the metadata that we're looking to update - something to think about
	
Web app:
	- access REST services above
	- user interface to work with providers
